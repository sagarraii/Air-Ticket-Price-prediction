**Project Title:** Airfare Price Prediction Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning

**Description:**
Booking a flight often feels like a gambleâ€”prices keep changing, and it's hard to know when to buy. This project started from a simple but frustrating problem: why are flight prices so unpredictable? To tackle this, I explored a real-world airfare dataset using data analysis and machine learning. The goal was to understand the hidden patterns behind ticket prices and build a model that could predict future fares based on key factors like airline, route, time of travel, duration, and stops. By making sense of these variables, the project aimed to give travelers more control and clarity, helping them book smarter and save money. It also opened up possibilities for travel apps and platforms to offer real-time, intelligent price suggestions.
